              SEO is important for several reasons. First and foremost, it helps
              businesses attract more qualified traffic to their website. When

              they are more likely to make a purchase if they can find the
              business easily. By optimising their website for search engines,
              businesses can increase their chances of being found and attract
              more relevant traffic.
